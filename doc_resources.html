                <h2>Resources</h2>

                <p>
                    Resources are a big part of any game, so, the engine provides a very handy way of
                    loading them and, at the same time, being able to use any of them everywhere, even
                    inside the <strong>prefab</strong> files (as a normal variable inside expressions or
                    as references with the <strong>@</strong> token).
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Resources class is the class to use for loading resources. The idea is simple: create
                    a class that extends the Resources class, and then, define public static values inside static
                    classes (as folders) for every resource you need to load.
                </p>

                <p>
                    But, the engine doesn't stop there, if you have your resources organized exactly like
                    you have them in your folders you can tell the loader to bind them automatically.
                </p>

                <p>
                    That sound pretty easy, doesn't it?, well, it is, as you can see in the example below:
                </p>

                <pre class="brush: java">
                    public class Res extends Resources
                    {
                        @BindLoad(path = "img/", extension = "png",
                            loader = BindLoad.Loader.TEXTURE)
                        public static class textures
                        {
                            public static Texture player;
                            public static Texture enemy01;
                            public static Texture enemy02;
                            public static Texture enemy03;
                        }

                        public Res(String root)
                        {
                            super(root);
                        }
                    }
                </pre>

                <p>
                    That code will automatically load those four textures with locations (assuming the root is assets/):
                </p>

                <pre class="brush: plain">
                    assets/img/player.png
                    assets/img/enemy01.png
                    assets/img/enemy02.png
                    assets/img/enemy03.png
                </pre>

                <p>
                    As you can see, the Res class has a inner class called textures, which has the annotation
                    <strong>BindLoad</strong> that says: This class with be an automatic bind load, which files
                    are inside the folder <strong>img/</strong>, with the extension <strong>png</strong> and are
                    loaded with the <strong>TEXTURE</strong> loader.
                </p>

                <p>
                    That's great, we can do a lot with that, but this doesn't stop there because we can have a lot
                    of special cases, such as:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>This one texture is not png, is jpg.</li>
                    <li>This one texture is not in that folder.</li>
                    <li>I have a lot of textures inside the <strong>img</strong> folder.</li>
                    <li>I need this resources to not load right away, because of dependencies (this happens
                        a lot with prefabs).</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    As these are fairly common situations the engine provides a way of solving them.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The first two are related to the same problem, we have <strong>exceptions</strong>,
                    and the engine can handle them in other way. In any case you need this, add the annotation
                    <strong>BindConfig</strong> to the field that requires it, as an example:
                </p>

                <pre class="brush: java">
                    public class Res extends Resources
                    {
                        @BindLoad(path = "img/", extension = "png",
                            loader = BindLoad.Loader.TEXTURE)
                        public static class textures
                        {
                            @BindConfig(skip = true)
                            public static Texture player;

                            @BindConfig(path = "img2/")
                            public static Texture enemy01;

                            @BindConfig(extension = "jpg")
                            public static Texture enemy02;

                            public static Texture enemy03;
                        }

                        public Res(String root)
                        {
                            super(root);
                        }
                    }
                </pre>

                <p>
                    There you can see each way of using the annotation, the first skips that resource (maybe you
                    have to generate the image later), the second one tells that the image is not inside img/, it is
                    inside img2/, and the third one says that the extension is jpg, not png.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Note:</strong> For the sake of code simplification, try to avoid exceptions in files.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Back to the special cases, the third case is easy to fix, just create an inner class inside
                    the inner class and set the <strong>BindLoad</strong> annotation again, the binder will
                    chain these as a folder hierarchy. Example:
                </p>

                <pre class="brush: java">
                    public class Res extends Resources
                    {
                        @BindLoad(path = "img/", extension = "png",
                            loader = BindLoad.Loader.TEXTURE)
                        public static class textures
                        {
                            public static Texture player;

                            @BindLoad(path = "enemies/", extension = "png",
                                loader = BindLoad.Loader.TEXTURE)
                            public static class enemies
                            {
                                public static Texture enemy01;
                                public static Texture enemy02;
                                public static Texture enemy02;
                            }
                        }

                        public Res(String root)
                        {
                            super(root);
                        }
                    }
                </pre>

                <p>
                    And now, this will load the files:
                </p>

                <pre class="brush: plain">
                    assets/img/player.png
                    assets/img/enemies/enemy01.png
                    assets/img/enemies/enemy02.png
                    assets/img/enemies/enemy03.png
                </pre>

                <p>
                    Excellent!.
                </p>

                <p>
                    And now the final case. This one is very rare, and I have only used it when loading
                    prefabs. The solution is pretty easy do.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In the <strong>BindLoad</strong> annotation, set the value <strong>skip</strong> to true,
                    this will make the initial loader to skip it, and then, inside the overridable load method
                    in the Resource class, add this line:
                </p>

                <pre class="brush: java">
                    bindLoad(prefabs.class)
                </pre>

                <p>
                    Assuming you have an <strong>inner class</strong> called prefabs, the engine
                    will load it as normally.
